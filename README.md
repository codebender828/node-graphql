# 🍇 Simple GraphQL data querying and mutation with Node.js & Express

> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Check out GraphQL's official documentation [here](https://graphql.github.io/)!

### Getting Started:
My preference is Yarn. Consequently my examples are also in yarn. But you can use NPM.

Install all Dependencies (Yarn or NPM). 
- `yarn install`

Start Express Server.
- `yarn dev:server`

Start JSON server to serve dummy data. This can be replaced with a real API service and database.
- `yarn json:server`

Open GraphiQL at `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to perform queries and mutations.
