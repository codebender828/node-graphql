# 🍇 Simple GraphQL data querying and mutation with Node.js & Express

> Functions that can return multiple values at different time interval, as per the user demands and can manage its internal state are generator functions. A function becomes a GeneratorFunction if it uses the function* syntax.

### Getting Started:
My preference is Yarn. Consequently my examples are also in yarn. But you can use NPM.

Install all Dependencies (Yarn or NPM). 
- `yarn install`

Start Express Server.
- `yarn dev:server`

Start JSON server to serve dummy data. This can be replaced with a real API service and database.
- `yarn json:server`

Open GraphiQL at `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to perform queries and mutations.
